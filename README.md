# 💪 LiftFocus: 10-Minute Workouts. No Gym. No Gear.

You're not here to waste time.

You're here because:
- You have back-to-back lectures
- Your internship starts at 9 AM
- You’re tired of skipping workouts
- You want to feel stronger — without needing a gym

That’s why **LiftFocus** exists.

## 🔥 What Is LiftFocus?

A free 7-day challenge that gives you:
- ✅ 10-minute no-equipment workouts (do them in your dorm, office, or hotel room)
- ✅ No-cook recipes (only 3 ingredients — yes, really)
- ✅ A simple habit that actually fits your schedule

No all-or-nothing mindset.  
No guilt if you miss a day.  
Just progress.

2. **Eat Freely — Stop at 8PM**  
   No dieting. Just a natural reset.
3. **Use What You Have**  
   Floor, wall, chair — that's all you need.
